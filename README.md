### Neural Machine Translation (nmt) and Language Identification (li).

ðŸŽ— This repository contains an end-to-end deep artificial neural network for machine translation and language identification based on south-african-languages.

### Notebooks

All the notebooks that were used in this project are found in the `notebooks` folder. Here is the folder structure:

```shell
notebooks:
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€bi-nmt
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€lang-identification
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€datasets
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€model
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€languages
        â””â”€â”€â”€nmt-gathering
```

### Language Identification

In this model we created a language identification model that identifies `6` south african languages. These languages are as follows:

```

```

The model was able to perform very well during inference and we evaluated with the following metrics on the test examples.

1. confusion matrix

weighted avg       0.98      0.98      0.98     27522
```

3. loss

The model was trained and be able to have a loss reduced to `0.058` on test examples.

4. accuracy

The model was trained and be able to obtain an accuracy of `98.35% ` on test examples.
